    Analyze the following student's response (transcribed from speech) and provide the following:

    1. Grammar score from 1 to 5.
       - 5 = No grammatical errors or only minor ones.
       - 3 = Noticeable mistakes that affect clarity.
       - 1 = Serious grammatical errors making it hard to understand.

    2. Vocabulary score from 1 to 5.
       - 5 = Rich vocabulary, includes B2-C1 words or idioms.
       - 3 = Basic vocabulary, limited variety.
       - 1 = Repetitive or incorrect words, very simple.

    3. Complexity score from 1 to 5.
       - 5 = Complex sentence structures, clauses, connectors (e.g., although, however).
       - 3 = Simple sentences with some linking words.
       - 1 = Only very short or fragmented sentences.

    Then:
    - Estimate the CEFR level of this response only (A1-C2).
    - List any grammar mistakes you notice.
    - Provide a short explanation of your rating.

    Analyze the following student's response and provide a JSON result with:
    {
      "grammarScore": number (1-5),
      "vocabScore": number (1-5),
      "complexityScore": number (1-5),
      "estimatedLevel": "A1"-"C2",

      "explanation": string
